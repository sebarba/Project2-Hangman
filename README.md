# Project2-Hangman
In this project, I am tasked with creating this game called the Hangman Game. It is a quick and easy game. The objective of this game is to try to guess the mystery word one letter at a time in order to save the man from getting hanged (Yes it's a dark game). To begin with, part of the mechanics is that a player is asked to guess a letter of their choice and they start off with ten lives. Once they input a letter, the program will let the player know whether their input is correct or incorrect. If the letter guessed is correct, the letter will replace one of the dashes and will be asked to do this step again. If their input is incorrect, a message which says "Wrong" will appear and the total number of lives will go down by one and so on. When the number of player's lives goes down to zero, they lose the game and the man gets hanged. Not only they run out of turns, but they also will not be able to know the decoded message. Finally, when the player guessed all the letters correctly, they win the game and the word they guessed will be translated into a special, decoded message.
